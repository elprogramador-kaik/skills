# Skills repo for tinyfish services!

This repo has, 
- tinyfish-web-agent: a skill for you to spin up web agents to your heart's desire to do anything and everything!
- tunelling: a skill to use the `tinyfi.sh` public service to allow you to expose your localhost env to others (kinda like ngrok but for free and no authentication!)
